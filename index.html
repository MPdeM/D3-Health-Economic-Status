          <h2>Data on Health-Poverty Trap: Call for Acction</h2>
          <p>It is well know that poverty is inextrincably linked with poor health. Living in poverty 
            makes an person high risk for poor health and at the same time living in poverty prevents
            for accessing good care or even healthcare. </p>
            <p>The data shown here, ( https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml), 
              colected over 2014, represents the stimates of a varyety of parameter:</p>
              <p>-  economic factors: average household income, percentage of population below poverty level.</p>
              <p>-  health factors : percentage with healthcare coverage, percentage obesity, percentage smokers. </p>
              <p>-  personal: age. </p>
            </p>
          <p> Obesity and smoking are factors that negativelly affect health and 
            correlate with % population below poverty with smoking and household income. The lower the income 
            the greater the amount of smokers and also the higher the amount of percentage obese population.
            Similarly, the higher the % of percentage of population below the poverth level the higher the 
            percentage of smokers and obese, althogth the correlation is loose. 
          </p>

          <p>As a side note, none of the health factors or economic factors is linked with mean age per state.  </p>

          <p>The wealth of a country  depends on all its members. Tackling inequalities is 
            key to figthing structural causes of poverty and poor health. Inproving health for everybody 
            improves socio-economical status. </p>
            <p>While It is harder to have good health for the population that lives in poverty.</p>
            <p>Another way of looking at the data is: Improving health for the poor will benefit all of us.
